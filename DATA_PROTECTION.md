# Cultural Data Protection Framework

## Purpose
This document outlines guidelines for handling cultural knowledge, traditional knowledge, and indigenous data within the AI_as_Kin relational AI system.

## Core Principles

### 1. Software vs. Content Distinction
- **Software Framework**: Apache 2.0 licensed - free to use, modify, distribute
- **Cultural Content**: Community-governed - requires appropriate permissions and protocols

### 2. Governance Frameworks
This system is designed to respect:
- **UNESCO 2003 Convention**: Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage
- **CARE Principles**: Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics
- **FPIC**: Free, Prior and Informed Consent for indigenous knowledge
- **Local Protocols**: Community-specific rules for cultural materials

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Cultural Institutions:
- Conduct community consultations before digitizing traditional knowledge
- Implement access controls for culturally sensitive materials
- Respect seasonal and gender-based knowledge restrictions

### For Developers:
- Design systems that can enforce community-specific access rules
- Build in attribution mechanisms for traditional knowledge holders
- Support multiple licensing schemes for different types of content

## Technical Implementation

### Access Control Templates
The system includes configurable access control templates for:
- Community-restricted knowledge
- Gender-specific cultural materials
- Seasonal or ceremonial knowledge
- Elder-approved content

### Metadata Standards
Cultural content should include metadata for:
- Cultural provenance and ownership
- Usage restrictions and protocols
- Contact information for knowledge holders
- Cultural significance classifications

## Compliance and Monitoring

### Regular Audits
- Review cultural content permissions annually
- Verify community consent remains current
- Update access controls as protocols evolve

### Community Engagement
- Establish cultural advisory boards for major deployments
- Provide training on digital rights and preservation
- Support community-led governance structures

*This framework ensures that while the AI technology remains freely available under Apache 2.0, the cultural knowledge it helps preserve remains under appropriate community governance.*
