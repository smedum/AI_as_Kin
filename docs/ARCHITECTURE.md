# System Architecture

## Core Components

### Relational Knowledge Graph
- Stores cultural knowledge as interconnected nodes
- Maintains provenance and attribution
- Supports multiple access protocols

### Harmonic Analysis Engine  
- Implements Fibonacci-based pattern recognition
- Uses Golden Ratio for balanced knowledge structures
- Euler-based growth modeling

### Cultural Protocol Layer
- Community-specific access controls
- FPIC verification systems
- Traditional knowledge labeling

## Data Flow

1. **Ingestion**: Cultural content with metadata
2. **Harmonic Analysis**: Pattern recognition and relationship mapping
3. **Community Validation**: Elder/keeper approval cycles
4. **Preservation**: Encoded in relational knowledge graphs
5. **Access**: Protocol-enforced query and retrieval

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python with knowledge graph database
- **APIs**: RESTful for integration
- **Storage**: Configurable (local/cloud/community-hosted)
- **Security**: Role-based access with cultural protocols

See [API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md) for technical details.
