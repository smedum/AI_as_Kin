# System Architecture: Sovereignty by Design

## üéØ Core Philosophy
*Before technical details: our architecture enforces relational principles at the mathematical level.*
- **Harmony Pattern**: Growth without domination (Fibonacci-based balance)
- **Boundary Pattern**: Understanding without appropriation (cultural protocols)
- **Consent Pattern**: Continuous ethical conversation (FPIC verification)

## üèõÔ∏è Core Components

### 1. Relational Knowledge Graph
*Implements the "Harmony Pattern" through interconnected wisdom*
- Stores cultural knowledge as sovereign, interconnected nodes
- Maintains provenance and attribution as non-negotiable metadata
- Supports multiple access protocols respecting different knowledge traditions
- **Sovereignty Feature**: Community-controlled graph partitioning

### 2. Harmonic Analysis Engine  
*Mathematical implementation of relational growth*
- Fibonacci-based pattern recognition for organic knowledge evolution
- Golden Ratio optimization for balanced knowledge structures
- Euler-based growth modeling for sustainable scaling
- **Sovereignty Feature**: Culturally-tuned harmonic parameters per community

### 3. Cultural Protocol Layer
*Operationalizes "Boundary & Consent Patterns"*
- Community-specific access controls with cryptographic enforcement
- FPIC (Free, Prior, Informed Consent) verification systems
- Traditional knowledge labeling and usage restrictions
- **Sovereignty Feature**: Real-time consent revocation capabilities

## üåä Data Flow: The Developmental Well in Motion

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

### Backend & Storage
- **Primary**: Python with knowledge graph database
- **Storage**: Configurable (local/cloud/**community-hosted**)
- **APIs**: RESTful for UNESCO/institutional integration
- **Security**: Role-based access **with cultural protocol enforcement**

### Sovereignty Infrastructure
- **Cryptographic Governance**: HSM-based community key custody
- **Relational Constraints**: Cultural laws as mathematical boundaries
- **Epistemic Routing**: Knowledge federation without assimilation

## üéØ UNESCO Alignment Features

### Direct Policy Implementation
- **2003 Convention Support**: Intangible cultural heritage encoding
- **UNDRIP Compliance**: Indigenous data sovereignty infrastructure  
- **CARE Principles**: Collective Benefit, Authority, Responsibility, Ethics
- **FPIC Protocols**: Digital adaptation of traditional consent processes

## üîÑ The Developmental Well Effect

This architecture is designed to **grow richer with use**:
- Each community implementation adds new relational patterns
- Harmonic analysis improves with diverse knowledge systems
- Cultural protocols become more nuanced through real-world application
- The entire system becomes more valuable while maintaining sovereignty
