### Augmentation, Not Replacement
- AI as research assistant, not authority
- Scholar maintains interpretive control
- Transparent methodology requirements

### Knowledge Democratization
- Lowers barriers to complex research
- Preserves marginalized perspectives
- Supports interdisciplinary connections

## Technical Safeguards

### Provenance Tracking
- All inferences source-attributed
- Versioned knowledge graphs
- Audit trails for research validation

### Challenge Mechanisms
- Built-in peer review simulation
- Alternative perspective surfacing
- Methodology questioning tools

### Open Scholarship
- Reproducible research support
- Multi-perspective knowledge representation
- Community-driven knowledge evolution

## Use Cases

### Research Enhancement
- Literature relationship mapping
- Cross-cultural concept bridging
- Historical context preservation

### Education Applications
- Culturally-grounded curriculum development
- Indigenous knowledge integration
- Multi-perspective learning tools
