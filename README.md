# AI_as_Kin

*Relational AI for Cultural Heritage Preservation*

## Overview

AI system developed for UNESCO distribution, treating AI as collaborative kin in preserving humanity's cultural and scientific heritage.

**Quick Start**: See `docs/QUICK_START.md`

## Documentation

- `NOTICE` - Attribution & context
- `DATA_PROTECTION.md` - Cultural governance
- `docs/` - Comprehensive documentation

## Mission

Supports UNESCO's cultural preservation mandate through relational AI frameworks. # Kincentric AI → Digital Sovereignty by Design

## 🛡️ Mission: Advancing UNESCO's Cultural Preservation Mandate

Kincentric AI provides the technical infrastructure to operationalize UNESCO's cultural preservation 
goals through relational intelligence. We bridge the gap between policy and implementation by offering:

### 🗣️ Language & Knowledge Sovereignty
- **Endangered Language Protection**: Cryptographic preservation of oral traditions and linguistic heritage
- **Intergenerational Transmission**: AI-facilitated knowledge exchange between elders and youth
- **Digital Repatriation**: Sovereign frameworks for cultural knowledge currently held in external archives

### 🌿 Biodiversity & Ecological Wisdom
- **Traditional Knowledge Encoding**: Mathematical preservation of indigenous ecological practices
- **Climate Resilience**: Relational AI models that incorporate generations of adaptation wisdom
- **Seed Sovereignty**: Protection of agricultural heritage and biocultural diversity

### 🏛️ UNESCO Alignment
Our architecture directly supports:
- **2003 Convention** - Safeguarding intangible cultural heritage
- **2005 Convention** - Protecting cultural expressions diversity  
- **UNESCO AI Ethics** - Human rights and ecological respect
- **UNDRIP Implementation** - Indigenous data sovereignty in practice

## 🎯 The Developmental Well Approach
Unlike extractive AI models, Kincentric AI functions as a sustainable resource that grows richer through use. Each implementation:
- Adds new relational patterns to the commons
- Strengthens the global sovereignty infrastructure
- Creates reusable frameworks for other communities
- Builds intergenerational resilience

## 🚀 Core Architecture
- **Governance-First Primitives**: Cryptographic sovereignty as operational baseline
- **Relational Loss Functions**: Cultural law encoded as mathematical constraints
- **Epistemic Federation**: Knowledge sharing without assimilation

## 💫 Get Started
```bash
git clone [repo]
npm install
npm run demo:cultural-sovereignty
